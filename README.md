# 2-My Data Structure libraries and Simple project on it

 This project implements a Queue Management System in C++ with functionalities for managing customer service lines in different scenarios like bill payments and subscriptions and It contains several data structure libraries that I built..

## Features:
- **Multiple Queues**: 
  - Two queues: one for bill payments and one for subscriptions.
- **Ticket Issuance**: 
  - Issue tickets to clients in both queues using the `IssueTicket()` method.
- **Queue Information**: 
  - View current status of each queue, including number of clients.
- **Ticket Display**: 
  - Print tickets in both Left-to-Right and Right-to-Left order.
- **Serve Clients**: 
  - Serve the next client in line using the `ServeNextClient()` method.
- **Detailed Information**: 
  - Print all tickets and queue information for both queues.

# 3-Secure Object-Oriented Banking System with Currency Exchanger

  - Set and modify exchange rates between different currencies.
  - Convert currency between supported types.
- **Banking Transactions**:

  - Perform deposit, withdrawal, and transfer of funds between clients.
  - Track client balances and transaction histories.
  - Ensure accurate transaction processing and validation.
- **Transaction Logs**:

  - Maintain a log of all transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and currency conversions.
